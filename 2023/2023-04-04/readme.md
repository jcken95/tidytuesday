Plot title: They think it's all over ... it usually is at half time
Subtitle: A team who is winning at half time will probably win the match. If there is a draw at half time, the final result is much harder to predict.

A sankey diagram showing the result (from the home team's perspective) of 2021/22 English Premier League football (soccer) games. There are 3 groups to the diagram: the first is kick off, where every time is drawing; the second group is half time where there is a roughly even split of win/draw/lose and the final is full time where the home team winning is the modal outcome, but this is only slightly larger than the proportion of home team losses. The smallest final group is the draw group ~ 20% of instances. Importantly, if the home team is winning at half time, they are highly likely to win the game. Similarly, if they lose at half time, they will likely lose the game. If there is a draw at half time, the final result is win/lose/draw with roughly equal proportions. 

Plot background is green; the sankey diagram and text are white to mimic a football pitch.
