Tag: #TidyTeusday | Data: Alone | @_jcken


Dumbell plot showing the minimum and maximum number of days survived by players in each season of "Alone". Top bar is Season 9, bottom is Season 1. Range of x axis is 0-100. Note that the height of the bars in the dumbbell are equal to the "weights" thus the dumbbell looks like a bar with rounded edges. The widest bar is for season 7 (10-100 days), shortest is season 5 (5-60 days).

Plot is themed in a minimalist grey theme. Plot background is a dark grey whereas all text and dumbbells are a light grey.
